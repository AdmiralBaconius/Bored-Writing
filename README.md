Chapter 1.

Saitama was sitting in his house at Z-City, feeling bored as always.

"Hey genos, where can I find a challenge? I've been feeling so bored lately"

"Calculation results: None. Although you can try the 26th annual martial arts tournament"

"Yeah, I guess i can find some hope there."

-Saitama was heading to the martial arts tournament registration counter-

"Number 3302"

"Oh, that's me."

-Saitama wasn't using a fake diguise this time, although he used his actual name Saitama instead of his given hero name 'caped baldy'-

"Here is extra details about the event, thank you for your time!"

-Saitama gets handed a yellow sheet of paper with a list of rules, there were demonstrations in the shape of images for each rule, but the demonstrator was a bald man presumed to be the current champion.-

"THOSE BASTARDS ARE MOCKING MY PERFECT HEAD!"

-Saitama would form a devious look on his face before spouting out in anger-

"IM GOING TO KICK HIS ASS AND GET MY MONEY SO I CAN STOP RELYING ON THOSE DAMN 10% OFF SPECIALS!"

-3 days later-

-loud snoring can be heard-

"Sensei, I politely state you should be waking up by now. The martial arts tournament is about to begin, and you dont want to be late. According to my calculations, it will take you approximately 2.4910 seconds to get to that destination, so you should -blah blah-"

-Saitama would smash his alarm clock grumpily as he gets up-

"That was way more than 20 words genos, thank you for the reminder that i should be going! That stupid champion is cosplaying me isnt he!?!?

1st match: Unnamed Brute vs Unnamed Technique user

"GO!"

-The brute user tried to launch a straight haymaker to the technique users face, but he parried it and using his open hand, he latched onto the attacking arm and broke it which made the brute fall to his unconsciousness"

"KNOCKOUT! GET THE AMBULANCE!"

-a few matches later-

6th match: Saitama vs Grand Master of the Z city dojo (Grand Master for short)

"I sense no technique or synchronised flow of brainwaves in his body. This will be an easy one" he quickly mutters to himself

-The grand master smoothly runs towards saitama and moves quickly sideways before delivering a "Steel Mangler Punch" to his liver-

"Is that an attack?"

"Hm, your skin didnt even move from the force. Ill try thi-"

"Serious series: Serious sideways jumps!"

He felt true speed and power in that one display. His brain could not fathom what training it would take to ensure such unbelievably massive power. Even the S class heroes would have a tough time dealing with him.

-As his brain overloaded with adrenaline of trying to predict his next move, he could not handle the overload of information that stood before him. A being of absolute power, yet absolute humility. That was a true hero...-

-The grandmaster lazily passed out and fell to the floor full speed due to the overload of information as his senses were way more keen and sensitive than the average person, making him analyze information at a bigger brain storage cost-

"What? Hes out?" As saitama looked around at the audience with a clueless look.

"KNOCKOUT BY UNDOCUMENTED MEANS!"

"SAITAMA WINS!"

A wave of applause and cheering filled the audience. Will saitamas ambitions be crushed when the tournament ends and his "average hero life" end? Or will somehow the events that happened at the tournament be overlooked? Will he fight the champion, beat him and feel dead inside once again? Find out on the next chapter!
