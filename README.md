Chapter 1.

Saitama was sitting in his house at Z-City, feeling bored as always.

"Hey genos, where can I find a challenge? I've been feeling so bored lately"

"Calculation results: None. Although you can try the 26th annual martial arts tournament"

"Yeah, I guess i can find some hope there."

-Saitama was heading to the martial arts tournament registration counter-

"Number 3302"

"Oh, that's me."

-Saitama wasn't using a fake diguise this time, although he used his actual name Saitama instead of his given hero name 'caped baldy'-

"Here is extra details about the event, thank you for your time!"

-Saitama gets handed a yellow sheet of paper with a list of rules, there were demonstrations in the shape of images for each rule, but the demonstrator was a bald man presumed to be the current champion.-

"THOSE BASTARDS ARE MOCKING MY PERFECT HEAD!"

-Saitama would form a devious look on his face before spouting out in anger-

"IM GOING TO KICK HIS ASS AND GET MY MONEY SO I CAN STOP RELYING ON THOSE DAMN 10% OFF SPECIALS!"

-3 days later-

-loud snoring can be heard-

"Sensei, I politely state you should be waking up by now. The martial arts tournament is about to begin, and you dont want to be late. According to my calculations, it will take you approximately 2.4910 seconds to get to that destination, so you should -blah blah-"

-Saitama would smash his alarm clock grumpily as he gets up-

"That was way more than 20 words genos, thank you for the reminder that i should be going! That stupid champion is cosplaying me isnt he!?!?

1st match: Unnamed Brute vs Unnamed Technique user

"GO!"

-The brute user tried to launch a straight haymaker to the technique users face, but he parried it and using his open hand, he latched onto the attacking arm and broke it which made the brute fall to his unconsciousness"

"KNOCKOUT! GET THE AMBULANCE!"

-a few matches later-

6th match: Saitama vs Grand Master of the Z city dojo (Grand Master for short)

"I sense no technique or synchronised flow of brainwaves in his body. This will be an easy one" he quickly mutters to himself

-The grand master smoothly runs towards saitama and moves quickly sideways before delivering a "Steel Mangler Punch" to his liver-

"Is that an attack?"

"Hm, your skin didnt even move from the force. Ill try thi-"

"Serious series: Serious sideways jumps!"

He felt true speed and power in that one display. His brain could not fathom what training it would take to ensure such unbelievably massive power. Even the S class heroes would have a tough time dealing with him.

-As his brain overloaded with adrenaline of trying to predict his next move, he could not handle the overload of information that stood before him. A being of absolute power, yet absolute humility. That was a true hero...-

-The grandmaster lazily passed out and fell to the floor full speed due to the overload of information as his senses were way more keen and sensitive than the average person, making him analyze information at a bigger brain storage cost-

"What? Hes out?" As saitama looked around at the audience with a clueless look.

"KNOCKOUT BY UNDOCUMENTED MEANS!"

"SAITAMA IS THE VICTOR!"

A wave of applause and cheering filled the audience. Will saitamas ambitions be crushed when the tournament ends and his "average hero life" end? Or will somehow the events that happened at the tournament be overlooked? Will he fight the champion, beat him and feel dead inside once again? Find out on the next chapter!

Chapter 2

After a while, The FINAL MATCH has begun.

"WE HAVE SAITAMA, A VERY STRONG FOE! AND WE HAVE TIEN SHINHAN, A MARTIAL ARTS PRODIGY! (he is a dragon ball character, here is the fandom page of him if you want to know about him: https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Tien_Shinhan)"

"LET THE MATCH BEGIN!"

"I can sense no ki from him, yet he knocked someone out from the pressure of his mere side steps. I might have to be cautious against him"

"YOU COPIED MY HAIR STYLE!!!!"

-Saitama would quickly step in for a normal punch, tien would use his ki pressure to clash with the force of the normal punch. Tien would successfully block the attack but get knocked back-

"How.. are you this strong? What's your name again?"

"Saitama."

"I will remember that name as the name of a powerful warrior! Lets continue!"

"Yeah, Im also glad you can survive my normal punch"

-Tien would punch saitama in the solar plexus with ki energy surrounding his fist and quickly move back with saitama not fazed by the attack at all-

-Tien would go in for the same tactic, but right when tien is about to punch saitama saitama would use his superior speed to move sideways of tien and chop his arm very casually-

"gh!"

"I guess ill have to use some more power!"

"DODON RAY!" tien shouts as he fires a yellow finger beam straight towards saitama

-Right before tiens dodon ray is about to hit saitama, he chants - "ONE HUNDRED FOLD!"

-The rays split into 100 smaller rays, each possessing 1/100 strength of the original-

"Consecutive normal punches."

-Saitama easily deflects the multitude of rays with a barrage of his "normal punches"-

"Is that all you've got? Im kind of getting bored now"

-Saitama yawns as the result of the mixture of not getting enough sleep and his opponent being so boring-

"Not yet!"

-tien screams heavily as he charges up to his full power, a white aura surrounding him-

-he then begins to remove his weighted clothing-

"All better. Im no longer holding back anything, so I expect the same!"

"Yeah sure alright, ill get a little more serious"

"NEO TRI BEAM!"

-tien jumps high into the air, forms his hand into a triangle shape and shoots a giant triangle beam from his hand downwards to saitama-

{Killer move; Serious Series: SERIOUS PUNCH]

-The beam gets eviscerated by saitamas punch, although not as easily as boros's move. The air reaches to tien and he gets a few cuts from it-

"You really are strong, your full power really is strong!"

"Dude, you're getting the wrong impression. I said that I was going to take the fight more seriously, not get serious in my punches."

"You're really pissing me off!"

-Tien started spinning his arms as fast as he could to give the appearance of windmills on his shoulder, then leaned in and delivered a barrage of blows to saitama-

"Consecutive norma-"

"KI REINFORCEMENT!"

-He starts to channel all of his ki into his fists giving them a strong orange aura-

"Oh, I have a move for this."

{Serious serious: Serious STARE.]

-Saitama just squinted his eyes which sended out multitudes of pressure breaking tiens balance and throwing him so far away he almost got knocked out of the ring but didnt-

"IM NOT DONE YET. FOUR WITCHES TECHNIQUE!"

-Tien sprouts two arms from just below his shoulder blades-

"NOW MULTI FORM!"

-Tien creates four copies of himself-

"This will use up all of my ki, you wont live past this!"

1st copy: "ULTRA DODON RAY: TWENTY WEB!" - (Ultra dodon ray is a game canon version of dodon ray, which is even stronger than super dodon ray, the second version. This time he forms a beam on each of his twenty fingers hence the name: "twenty WEB")

2nd copy: "FOUR HANDED SUPER KAMEHAMEHA!" - (He creates one big kamehameha using all of his four arms to create the stance)

3rd copy: "QUADRUPLE SPIRIT TRI-BEAM!" - (Spirit tri beam is an attack which uses life force, basically a one handed tri-beam but extremely powerful)

4th copy: -Silently tenses up his fist and charges a giant release of air pressure (kiai) from all four of his hands-

all in unison: TRI DODON KAMEHAMEHA!

-The super kamehameha is in the center of the chaos, the tri beams are surrounding the kamehameha, and the dodon rays are surrounding the tri beams. The air pressure was just to buff the damage output of the attack-

"Alright. Im SERIOUSLY done with this." As saitama yawns yet again and picks his nose

{Serious series: "Gold coin shot"}

-saitama flicks his booger at the beam and the clones all in unison get even more mad and the power of the beam triples in according to their rage-

-suddenly, the beam tien made was dispersed of and the booger broke the walls of the martial arts tournament and travelled into the far ends of the universe-

-Tiens clones disperse and only his original self remains, still conscious with blood and newly-formed scars all over his body, and non visible ki steam erupting from every part of his body due to the overclock of power he put his body through-

"Heh... I hope we fight again, there are many more stronger than me.. I cannot believe you stopped my all out assault with that little party trick of yours"

"You were strong, even stronger than that alien guy. Possibly the second strongest thing ive ever fought, and the strongest human ive ever fought. Well you have three eyes but I bet its part of a cosplay, right?" (the "1st strongest" is referring to garou in his cosmic form.)

"S.sssaitama w..wins" -the referee collapses from the sheer sight of it and all of the audience have already passed out from the sheer force of the 1st exchange of blows they have made, saitamas hero identity remains modest once again!-

Clarifications

Q: How much strength does saitama have in this series?

The same strength he had at the end of the cosmic garou fight with his "exponential growth"

Q: How the HELL did a dragon ball character enter the OPM verse?

A quantum physics bug which plucks out a random dragon ball character every once and a while and sends them to this world making them think its their original world. The illusion to think that its their original world doesnt work on Gods of Destruction and above
